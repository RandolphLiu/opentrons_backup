# Rust Lab Opentrons

The Jupyter notebook is a natural way to communicate with the robot
on the fly, and allows the protocol to refer to external scripts,
which are lacking in the APP.

However, I assume that the disk is erased every time
a firmware is written to the robot.
So, ALWAYS backup the notebooks here.
